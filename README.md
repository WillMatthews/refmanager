A more usable alternative to EndNote, made for AgriCoat Ltd as FOSS, to organise a scientific paper library

## Work in Progress...

###So far we have:
* search page (not tied to DB yet)
* XML parser (not populating DB yet)
* list of missing entries

###Next targets are:
* get DB working!
* populate DB!
* make search page work with DB!

###Todos:
[] "Add Record" page (suggest successor of max of keys)
[] "Edit Record" page (remove record)
[] "Search"
  [x] Sort by record number, date (sort by author?)
  [] Search by keyword, abstracts, titles, record number and/or author
[] 'errors' page
  [] highlight missing PDFs
  [] highlight spelling errors?
  [] highlight missing record numbers
